# Warning

I am not responsable if you somehow get banned from any game for using this.
# Instructions
If you don't want to use roblox as a process, simply change the process name to the executable of your choice.

If you are fine with Roblox, Simply run the executable WITH the game open and thats it!
If you don't have the target process open the program will simply close.
